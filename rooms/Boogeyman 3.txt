What is the PID of the process that executed the initial stage 1 payload?
6392

The stage 1 payload attempted to implant a file to another location. What is the full command-line value of this execution?
"C:\Windows\System32\xcopy.exe" /s /i /e /h D:\review.dat C:\Users\EVAN~1.HUT\AppData\Local\Temp\review.dat

The implanted file was eventually used and executed by the stage 1 payload. What is the full command-line value of this execution?
"C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe" D:\review.dat,DllRegisterServer

The stage 1 payload established a persistence mechanism. What is the name of the scheduled task created by the malicious script?
Review

The execution of the implanted file inside the machine has initiated a potential C2 connection. What is the IP and port used by this connection? (format: IP:port)
165.232.170.151:80

The attacker has discovered that the current access is a local administrator. What is the name of the process used by the attacker to execute a UAC bypass?
fodhelper.exe

Having a high privilege machine access, the attacker attempted to dump the credentials inside the machine. What is the GitHub link used by the attacker to download a tool for credential dumping?
https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases/download/2.2.0-20220919/mimikatz_trunk.zip

After successfully dumping the credentials inside the machine, the attacker used the credentials to gain access to another machine. What is the username and hash of the new credential pair?
itadmin:F84769D250EB95EB2D7D8B4A1C5613F2

Using the new credentials, the attacker attempted to enumerate accessible file shares. What is the name of the file accessed by the attacker from a remote share?

After getting the contents of the remote file, the attacker used the new credentials to move laterally. What is the new set of credentials discovered by the attacker?
QUICKLOGISTICS\allan.smith:Tr!ckyP@ssw0rd987

What is the hostname of the attacker's target machine for its lateral movement attempt?
WKSTN-1327

Using the malicious command executed by the attacker from the first machine to move laterally, what is the parent process name of the malicious command executed on the second compromised machine?
wsmprovhost.exe

The attacker then dumped the hashes in this second machine. What is the username and hash of the newly dumped credentials? 
administrator:00f80f2538dcb54e7adc715c0e7091ec

After gaining access to the domain controller, the attacker attempted to dump the hashes via a DCSync attack. Aside from the administrator account, what account did the attacker dump?
